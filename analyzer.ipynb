But official story definitely causes questions.<br><br>As of why exactly would anyone do something like that, there is only one reasonable explanation. Religion has to be old. Generally religion is already at least 200-300 years old in the moment of its creation, but the older it is, the better. Imagine if for example Europe was violently taken over by alien, hostile and brutal religion, and that religion wanted to maintain its long term power in Europe, it would have been a good idea for them to use their monopoly on historical records to create a picture about how this religion actually already reigns there for 500+ years, Europeans converted into it on their own volition and it was them who were savage and brutal until religion civilized them and taught them morals. <br><br>As of hypothetical circumstances of this takeover, something like this would have happened if semite who worships Baal somehow became Roman emperor and made every Roman subject into Roman citizen, but then light went out and something involving rather lot of violence that modern history knows as &quot;3rd century crisis&quot; occurred on Roman territory.\n",

That would be Roman equivalent of doing this. Just in 20 years, when they all move into heartland, light goes out. No way to say what exactly was happening there, but it was certainly very brutal and can be characterized by phrase KILL WHITEY. When some glimpses into history reemerge after crisis ends, Rome is obliterated. By the way there are still some clues that can be found it Roman catacombs, but Catholics refuse to let archaeologists explore most of it for some reason.<br><br>&quot;Official&quot; fall of Rome story involves fleet strike from the direction of Carthage. As much as patchwork hackjob it is, it likely was still assembled out of scraps of real events. Officially, fleet strike was performed by mysterious central European tribe that traversed most of Western Europe, then North Africa, then settled in Carthage and attacked Rome from there. Makes about as much sense as &quot;Nazi Germany attacked Poland, Poles were displaced and by running away from Germans invaded USSR and destroyed it&quot;. But there is still account of Rome being attacked from the sea, only it got scattered in all subsequent chaos and later attached to Church&#039;s hackjob history.<br><br>As of why did they destroy Rome. Western semites were practicing human sacrifice religion. Archaeologist find way too many charred infant bones in areas populated by them. It was outlawed by Rome when they crushed Carthage, and since they were taking their religion very seriously, Rome became enemy of all they hold sacred. Rome had to be destroyed for obstructing Baal from getting his infants as burned offering. Abrahamic scripture happens to have weird fixation on human sacrifice concepts, and there are no other religions to which it can be traced except Carthage&#039;s one.\n",

      "<span class=\"quote\">&gt;Historical linguists trace the origin of the Ukrainian language to Old East Slavic, a language of the early medieval state of Kievan Rus&#039;. Modern linguistics denies the existence of a stage of a common East Slavic language, therefore, referring the Ukrainian language to &quot;East Slavonic&quot; is also more of a tribute to the academic tradition.[10] After the fall of the Kievan Rus&#039; as well as the Kingdom of Ruthenia, the language developed into a form called the Ruthenian language, and enjoyed as such the status of one of the official languages of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania for several centuries.[11] Along with Ruthenian, in the territory of modern Ukraine, the Kyiv version (Kyiv Izvod) of Church Slavonic was also used in liturgical services.[12]</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;The Ukrainian language has been in common use since the late 17th century, associated with the establishment of the Cossack Hetmanate. From 1804 until the 1917–1921 Ukrainian War of Independence, the Ukrainian language was banned from schools in the Russian Empire, of which the biggest part of Ukraine (Central, Eastern and Southern) was a part at the time.[13] Through folk songs, itinerant musicians, and prominent authors, the language has always maintained a sufficient base in Western Ukraine, where the language was never banned.[14][15]</span><br>This chimp out has been going on for a literal millenia <br>Russians have been trying to convince Ukrainians they have never existed for centuries<br>Lmao\n",

It&#039;s unfit for full scale of tasks proper language can be used for, similar to how lingo of criminal subculture can&#039;t be used for art, scientific process or diplomacy. After gaining independence, Ukrainians attempted to translate nuclear power plant manuals into that, it fucking horrified America and Europe and they had to use their influence to prevent it.\n",
      "<a href=\"#p14162369\" class=\"quotelink\">&gt;&gt;14162369</a><br>Lingual development can be traced back to differing developmental paths due to historic circumstances<br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;In the 13th century, eastern parts of Rus (including Moscow) came under Tatar rule until their unification under the Tsardom of Muscovy, whereas the south-western areas (including Kyiv) were incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. For the following four centuries, the languages of the two regions evolved in relative isolation from each other. Direct written evidence of the existence of the Ukrainian language dates to the late 16th century.[28] By the 16th century, a peculiar official language formed: a mixture of the liturgical standardised language of Old Church Slavonic, Ruthenian and Polish. The influence of the latter gradually increased relative to the former two, as the nobility and rural large-landowning class, known as the szlachta, was largely Polish-speaking. Documents soon took on many Polish characteristics superimposed on Ruthenian phonetics.[29]</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Polish rule and education also involved significant exposure to the Latin language. Much of the influence of Poland on the development of the Ukrainian language has been attributed to this period and is reflected in multiple words and constructions used in everyday Ukrainian speech that were taken from Polish or Latin. Examples of Polish words adopted from this period include zavzhdy (always; taken from old Polish word zawżdy) and obitsiaty (to promise; taken from Polish obiecać) and from Latin (via Polish) raptom (suddenly) and meta (aim or goal).[27]</span><br><span class=\"quote\">&gt;Significant contact with Tatars and Turks resulted in many Turkic words, particularly those involving military matters and steppe industry, being adopted into the Ukrainian language. Examples include torba (bag) and tyutyun (tobacco).[27]</span>\n",

Only text mentions. It happens that text is very easy to tamper with, unlike creation of counterfeit work of art (abrahamics never really caught up to Romans on that so it was beyond them even if they tried very hard)Hagia Sophia and Suleymanie look like they are raised by same cadre of architects and builders. It is claimed that they are totally 1k year apart and one just got copied haha. Ottoman empire was continuously declining for entirety of historical span that can be considered reliable. Catholic church was continuously assassinating scholars attempting to study Egypt.

There are various theories about which periods exactly are fictionalhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_time_hypothesishttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/New_chronology_(Fomenko)However those are just an attempts to blindly stumble in the dark trying to find something, and none of what they find can be considered fully reliable because there are literally no stable points of reference there, it's a black hole. But official story definitely causes questions.As of why exactly would anyone do something like that, there is only one reasonable explanation. Religion has to be old. Generally religion is already at least 200-300 years old in the moment of its creation, but the older it is, the better. Imagine if for example Europe was violently taken over by alien, hostile and brutal religion, and that religion wanted to maintain its long term power in Europe, it would have been a good idea for them to use their monopoly on historical records to create a picture about how this religion actually already reigns there for 500+ years, Europeans converted into it on their own volition and it was them who were savage and brutal until religion civilized them and taught them morals. As of hypothetical circumstances of this takeover, something like this would have happened if semite who worships Baal somehow became Roman emperor and made every Roman subject into Roman citizen, but then light went out and something involving rather lot of violence that modern history knows as \"3rd century crisis\" occurred on Roman territory.\n",

The Romans tried to go through it to conquer Yemen but that failed, but they were never trying to outright conquer that in between place because it didn't seem like there would be anything to conquer.\n",

When some glimpses into history reemerge after crisis ends, Rome is obliterated. By the way there are still some clues that can be found it Roman catacombs, but Catholics refuse to let archaeologists explore most of it for some reason.\"Official\" fall of Rome story involves fleet strike from the direction of Carthage. As much as patchwork hackjob it is, it likely was still assembled out of scraps of real events. Officially, fleet strike was performed by mysterious central European tribe that traversed most of Western Europe, then North Africa, then settled in Carthage and attacked Rome from there. Makes about as much sense as \"Nazi Germany attacked Poland, Poles were displaced and by running away from Germans invaded USSR and destroyed it\". But there is still account of Rome being attacked from the sea, only it got scattered in all subsequent chaos and later attached to Church's hackjob history.As of why did they destroy Rome. Western semites were practicing human sacrifice religion. Archaeologist find way too many charred infant bones in areas populated by them. It was outlawed by Rome when they crushed Carthage, and since they were taking their religion very seriously, Rome became enemy of all they hold sacred. Rome had to be destroyed for obstructing Baal from getting his infants as burned offering. Abrahamic scripture happens to have weird fixation on human sacrifice concepts, and there are no other religions to which it can be traced except Carthage's one.\n",

      ">Historical linguists trace the origin of the Ukrainian language to Old East Slavic, a language of the early medieval state of Kievan Rus'. Modern linguistics denies the existence of a stage of a common East Slavic language, therefore, referring the Ukrainian language to \"East Slavonic\" is also more of a tribute to the academic tradition.[10] After the fall of the Kievan Rus' as well as the Kingdom of Ruthenia, the language developed into a form called the Ruthenian language, and enjoyed as such the status of one of the official languages of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania for several centuries.[11] Along with Ruthenian, in the territory of modern Ukraine, the Kyiv version (Kyiv Izvod) of Church Slavonic was also used in liturgical services.[12]The Ukrainian language has been in common use since the late 17th century, associated with the establishment of the Cossack Hetmanate. From 1804 until the 1917–1921 Ukrainian War of Independence, the Ukrainian language was banned from schools in the Russian Empire, of which the biggest part of Ukraine (Central, Eastern and Southern) was a part at the time.[13] Through folk songs, itinerant musicians, and prominent authors, the language has always maintained a sufficient base in Western Ukraine, where the language was never banned.[14][15] This chimp out has been going on for a literal millenia Russians have been trying to convince Ukrainians they have never existed for centuriesLmao\n",
      "Ukrainian language is an essentially a lumpen slang of Russian language, like Cockney for English. It's unfit for full scale of tasks proper language can be used for, similar to how lingo of criminal subculture can't be used for art, scientific process or diplomacy. After gaining independence, Ukrainians attempted to translate nuclear power plant manuals into that, it fucking horrified America and Europe and they had to use their influence to prevent it.\n",
      "Lingual development can be traced back to differing developmental paths due to historic circumstancesIn the 13th century, eastern parts of Rus (including Moscow) came under Tatar rule until their unification under the Tsardom of Muscovy, whereas the south-western areas (including Kyiv) were incorporated into the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. For the following four centuries, the languages of the two regions evolved in relative isolation from each other. Direct written evidence of the existence of the Ukrainian language dates to the late 16th century.[28] By the 16th century, a peculiar official language formed: a mixture of the liturgical standardised language of Old Church Slavonic, Ruthenian and Polish. The influence of the latter gradually increased relative to the former two, as the nobility and rural large-landowning class, known as the szlachta, was largely Polish-speaking. Documents soon took on many Polish characteristics superimposed on Ruthenian phonetics.[29]Polish rule and education also involved significant exposure to the Latin language. Much of the influence of Poland on the development of the Ukrainian language has been attributed to this period and is reflected in multiple words and constructions used in everyday Ukrainian speech that were taken from Polish or Latin. Examples of Polish words adopted from this period include zavzhdy (always; taken from old Polish word zawżdy) and obitsiaty (to promise; taken from Polish obiecać) and from Latin (via Polish) raptom (suddenly) and meta (aim or goal).[27]Significant contact with Tatars and Turks resulted in many Turkic words, particularly those involving military matters and steppe industry, being adopted into the Ukrainian language. Examples include torba (bag) and tyutyun (tobacco).[27]\n",

      "Its position makes Russia vulnerable and Russians are incensed that Ukrainians would try to leverage that position to their advantage instead of just rolling over for Russia\n",
